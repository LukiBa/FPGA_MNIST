This is a university project at TU Vienna to create a neural network 
hardware accelerator with an FPGA.

## Goals

- Setup FPGA to communicate with PC or use embedded Linux
- Implement Forward & Backward Propagation in Python to ensure functionality
- Create VHDL files for the various operations
- Handle on board communication
