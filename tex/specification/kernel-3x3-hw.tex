\subsection{kernel-3x3}
This modules performs a multiplication of 9 values of length BIT\_WIDTH\_IN with their respective weights which are defined in an
array that can be set with a generic. The multiplication results are then added up, after which a ReLu step is performed where outputs
above 255 are clipped to 255 and outputs below 0 are clipped to 0.
\subsubsection{Interface}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Input interface, a vector of 9 values of length BIT\_WIDTH\_IN.
	\item Output interface, same as conv\_channel.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Parameter}
\begin{itemize}
	\item BIT\_WIDTH\_IN: integer
	\item BIT\_WIDTH\_OUT: integer
	\item WEIGHT: array of 9 integers
	\item WEIGHT\_WIDTH: integer
\end{itemize}
