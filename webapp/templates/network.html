    <h2>The designed Network</h2>
     <p>
         The networks design is based on LeCun's LeNet which was already introduced in 1999.
         We used a combination of Convolutional, Pooling and Fully connected layers.

     <h3>Quantization of the network</h3>
     For a sreal floating point number we can represent it via
     $$ v = Q \cdot 2^{-m}  $$
    where $Q$ and $m$ are integers
